# You might expect that this file would contain a bunch of loops that
# compute what memberships people are supposed to have and then add
# them to it.  No, that would require Terraform to support sane state
# transitions which it doesn't.  In order to add or remove people in
# github, terraform nukes the membership and then adds everyone back
# as requested.

# Yes, this includes the organization owners.

# Literally the only thing that saved us while running this in setup
# was that GitHub's API won't let you delete yourself from the
# organization if you're the last man standing.  So now we have this
# expanded monstrosity which puts people in groups the long way round.
