# At which server does the buildmaster reside?  This should be in the
# form of a dotted hostname or an IP address.  While this may be
# overriden in the case of builders running on the buildmaster itself
# to 'localhost', it is preferred to use the full canonical name in
# all locations for consistency.  If persistent resolution issues are
# preventing a host from connecting to the buildmaster this name
# should very likely be specified in the hosts file.

# The following list contains hashes for the builders.  For standards

# if existing builders are being captured for ansible management, the
# directory and service_name should be specified to match those of the
# existing buildbot directory name and runit service directory
# respecitvely.

# The following hash is shown for structure, but should never be

# and passwords which are recognized by the buildmaster.  At least one
# complete copy of this must be available to at least a single

# re-iterate: never commit this hash under any circumstances, it is to
# be included from the secret/ directory and by default will be
# included from the 'secret/buildslave_credentials.yml' path.  In
# order for this map to work correctly, the architecture must match
# exactly that of the builder that is performing the lookup as
# specified in the above list.  For standards, use architecture
# identifiers as they would be printed by `xbps-uhelper arch`.
